At the same time, as an early-stage technology, its evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and unintended or unforeseen consequences. Large language models can generate output that you don't expect, including text that's offensive, insensitive, or factually incorrect.\n","\n","What's more, the incredible versatility of LLMs is also what makes it difficult to predict exactly what kinds of unintended or unforeseen outputs they might produce. Given these risks and complexities, the PaLM API is designed with [Google's AI Principles](https://ai.google/principles/) in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy safely and responsibly. To aid developers, the Generative AI Studio has built-in content filtering, and the PaLM API has safety attribute scoring to help customers test Google's safety filters and define confidence thresholds that are right for their use case and business. Please refer to the [Safety filters and attributes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#safety_filters_and_attributes) section to learn more.\n","\n","When the PaLM API is integrated into a customer's unique use case and context, additional responsible AI considerations and [PaLM limitations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#palm_limitations) may need to be considered.
